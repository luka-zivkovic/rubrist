Inspect safe, relevant project text before asking me to repeat context. Tell me what AI system and recorded case evidence you found, then ask one short decision-changing question. Show a proposed evaluator with what it decides, the exact evidence it reads, what it cannot know, and its Rubric. Keep it Starter · unvalidated.

Offer “Finish setup” or “Refine the evaluator.” Do not ask me to create a Rubrist connection until I choose Finish setup. Never read .env or credential files, invent a case, make a human judgment, promote a Golden example, or make a release decision.`;

Use the $rubrist-setup skill (or read https://github.com/luka-zivkovic/rubrist/blob/main/plugins/rubrist/skills/rubrist-setup/SKILL.md if it is unavailable). Apply the exact evaluator proposal I reviewed; if no proposal has been reviewed yet, pause and complete its short context-first preparation flow before using this connection. Use the rubrist-audit transport for ongoing capture and submission. Provide the token through RUBRIST_PAIRING_TOKEN; never write it into setup files or repeat it in output. Submit a first batch only when a real case is already available. Report the evaluator as Starter · unvalidated, and stop before human adjudication, Golden promotion, governed activation, or release decisions.

This connection expires at ${pairing.expiresAt} and can be used once.`;
