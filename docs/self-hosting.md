# Self-hosting and test-instance updates

## Status and support boundary

- **TARGET:** a Rubrist release is an exact semantic version published as
  `ghcr.io/luka-zivkovic/rubrist-{api,web}:X.Y.Z`, plus matching generic
  single-host and Coolify Compose bundles.
- **CURRENT:** `v0.3.0` is the first release published under the Rubrist name,
  with `rubrist-api` and `rubrist-web` images and `RUBRIST_*` variables.
  The workflow builds both architectures, boots the published bundle, and
  verifies its health endpoint before the GitHub release is published.
- **CURRENT:** `v0.2.0` remains the historical Coeval release, with its original
  image names and variable prefix. The renamed PostgreSQL baseline differs:
  install `v0.3.0` into a clean instance, not the old database volume. See
  [ADR-0012](decisions/0012-rename-coeval-to-rubrist.md). The earlier `v0.1.0`
  predates installable container artifacts and must not be selected.
- **CURRENT:** founder-only deployments are disposable test instances. This
  pre-launch release supports clean database installs only; recreate the
  instance when the current baseline changes.
- **ASSUMPTION:** the default stack runs on one Coolify server, exposes only
  the nginx `web` service through TLS, and keeps the API and Postgres private.

## SQLite installation

**CURRENT:** SQLite installation and recovery tooling is implemented;
[release qualification](sqlite/milestone-6.md) records its pending review and
release status. It has not been released by this work. See
[SQLite installation and recovery](sqlite-operations.md) for the separate
SQLite template, installer, readiness, backup/restore and forward-only upgrade
contract. The existing trustctl distribution remains PostgreSQL-only. The
pre-launch PostgreSQL baseline/reset policy below does not reset SQLite history.

## Generic single-host bundle

`deploy/self-host/compose.yaml` is the platform-neutral, release-owned bundle
for a Linux host with Docker Engine and Compose v2. It pins one exact Rubrist
application version, exposes only the web service on loopback by default, and
persists Postgres in a named volume. `compose.yaml.sha256` is validated by the
release workflow so a tag cannot publish with a stale bundle checksum.

The separate pre-release `trustctl` CLI installs this bundle, generates the
required secrets, preserves operator additions in `compose.override.yaml`,
and provides `status`, `doctor`, update checking, and explicit updates. It is
not part of Rubrist's runtime and receives no Docker or hosting credentials.
[trustctl v0.2.0](https://github.com/luka-zivkovic/trustctl/releases/tag/v0.2.0),
this bundle, and the Rubrist images are public. Its bootstrap integration test
installs the published Rubrist and Ironside 0.3.0 bundles and verifies health,
status, update discovery and owner setup.

Coolify remains a separate deployment method. Its control plane owns the
saved Compose and environment state; trustctl neither adopts nor updates a
Coolify Service.

## Coolify install

`deploy/coolify.yaml` is both the source for a future Coolify catalog template
and a template that can be pasted into **Docker Compose Empty** today.

1. Create a Docker Compose Empty Service in the target project/environment.
2. Paste `deploy/coolify.yaml` and save it.
3. Set `RUBRIST_VERSION` to an exact published release such as `0.3.0`. Do not
   use `latest`, `main`, or another floating value.
4. Confirm Coolify generated the `SERVICE_URL_WEB`, Postgres password, auth
   secret, and bootstrap token. Do not replace those values during an update.
5. Deploy. The web component's health check traverses nginx to the API, while
   the API health check verifies the process and Postgres gates startup.
6. Open the generated web URL and complete owner setup.

Coolify copies a one-click template into each Service; later catalog changes
do not rewrite an existing instance. The saved Compose definition and its
environment values therefore remain the instance's update contract.

Official Coolify catalog publication is a distribution follow-up. Coolify's
current contribution policy requires the upstream repository to have at least
1,000 GitHub stars. That requirement does not prevent testing or operating the
same Compose definition as a user-defined Service.

## Release contract

Bump the root `package.json` version, merge it, and push the matching exact
`vX.Y.Z` tag. A mismatch fails the release before publishing. The workflow
runs the full build, typecheck, and test suite, verifies the generic Compose
checksums and renders for both backends, guards shared contracts and repository
boundaries, then publishes amd64 and arm64 API/web images with:

- the immutable `X.Y.Z` tag used by operators;
- a `sha-<full commit>` traceability tag;
- OCI source, revision, and version metadata; and
- build provenance and an SBOM.

After every image publishes, the workflow renders all four shipped Compose and
Coolify templates and verifies that their API/web image references match those
exact release tags. It then pulls the tags and runs the PostgreSQL and SQLite
drills with explicit image and disposable-port overrides, creates an owner
and harness key, runs a local mock evaluation, and verifies exact receipt bytes
after restart and container replacement. SQLite also verifies backup and fresh
volume restore. Only then does it create a **draft** GitHub release with both
Compose/checksum pairs and both Coolify recipes attached. After the
first workflow run, an owner must make both GHCR packages public; package
visibility persists for later versions. Verify an anonymous pull of both exact
tags, declare whether the current baseline changed, and publish the draft. Default
trustctl installs and update checks see only that published release, so the
draft is the release-readiness gate.

Every pre-launch release note must declare one of:

- **Baseline unchanged:** the founder-owned test instance may update images in
  place and may roll back to the prior exact image.
- **Baseline changed:** create a clean test instance; no in-place schema
  migration or downgrade is supported.

## Updating an instance

1. Read every release note between the installed and target versions.
2. If the baseline changed, create a clean Service and stop; do not attach the
   old Postgres volume.
3. If the baseline is unchanged, record the current Compose, exact image
   version, generated secrets, domain, and scheduled tasks.
4. Change both Rubrist image references by changing the
   single `RUBRIST_VERSION` value. Merge any release-specific Compose changes.
5. Deploy and verify `/health`, sign-in, project reads, and a background job.

Do not use Coolify's **Pull Latest Images & Restart** for Rubrist. An exact
semantic-version tag is immutable, so a normal redeploy is sufficient. A
floating tag can silently combine a new application and a changed baseline.

## Backups and secrets

The Postgres component exposes the standard `POSTGRES_USER`,
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` variables, allowing Coolify to create a
database-aware scheduled backup for the database inside the Service. Send a
copy to off-host S3-compatible storage and regularly restore into a disposable
database; a successful dump alone is not a recovery test.

`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` also encrypts stored integration credentials. Losing or
changing it invalidates sessions and makes those credentials unreadable.
Preserve it in a separate secret-manager/instance-recovery record; do not put
it in the database backup itself.

Persistent volumes survive ordinary container replacement but are not
backups. Never delete or rename `rubrist_postgres_data` as part of an update.

## Local image smoke test

Before publishing a release:

```sh
docker build -f apps/api/Dockerfile -t rubrist-api:smoke .
docker build -f apps/web/Dockerfile -t rubrist-web:smoke .
RUBRIST_VERSION=0.3.0 docker compose -f deploy/coolify.yaml config >/dev/null
RUBRIST_VERSION=0.3.0 \
  RUBRIST_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=render-only \
  RUBRIST_AUTH_SECRET=render-only-secret-at-least-32-bytes \
  docker compose -f deploy/self-host/compose.yaml config >/dev/null
```

Use the actual candidate version in the final command. The Compose render does
not prove GHCR visibility or database restore safety; verify both separately.
