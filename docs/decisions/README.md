# Rubrist architecture decisions

ADRs record product and architecture choices that refine `PRODUCT.md`.

Status meanings:

- **Accepted:** authoritative until superseded by another accepted ADR.
- **Proposed:** recommended direction awaiting founder review; do not build new
  runtime behavior that depends on it.
- **Superseded:** retained for history, with a link to its replacement.
